The ComfyStream package provides native nodes essential for real-time AI workflows in ComfyUI, handling tasks like converting audio and images into tensors, processing data, and converting tensors back into usable formats. Additionally, the **ComfyStream Toolkit** includes a **StreamPack**, which extends functionality with advanced custom nodes for video, audio, and data workflows. Learn more in the [StreamPack Overview](/technical/custom-nodes/stream-pack/overview) page.

## Input Nodes

ComfyStream provides input nodes to convert media inputs into tensors, enabling AI processing in real-time workflows.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="LoadAudioTensor">
    Converts audio inputs into tensors for use in ComfyUI workflows.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="LoadTensor">
    Converts image inputs into tensor format for computation in AI workflows.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="PrimaryInputLoadImage">
    A passthrough node that specifies a reference image for real-time AI
    workflows, such as LivePortrait.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Output Nodes

ComfyStream provides output nodes to convert tensors back into media formats for real-time streaming.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="SaveAudioTensor">
    Converts audio tensors into audio frames.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="SaveTensor">
    Converts image tensors into image frames.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Task-Specific Nodes

Most task-specific nodes are part of the StreamPack, but the ComfyStream package includes a few for example purposes.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="PitchShifter">
    Shifts the pitch of an input audio stream, demonstrating audio
    transformations in real-time workflows.
    <Tip>
      Check out the [Example Workflow](https://github.com/livepeer/comfystream/blob/main/workflows/comfystream/audio-tensor-utils-example-api.json) to see the `PitchShifter` in action.
