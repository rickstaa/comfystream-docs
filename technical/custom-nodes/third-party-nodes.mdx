The ComfyStream team has identified several third-party nodes that are highly compatible with ComfyStream and can enhance your real-time AI workflows. While these nodes are not maintained by the ComfyStream team, they are recommended for their functionality and compatibility.

## Optimization Nodes

Nodes in this category are designed to improve performance and reduce latency in real-time workflows.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion header="NVIDIA TensorRT" title="NVIDIA TensorRT">
    Optimizes stable diffusion performance by generating a static TensorRT engine based on Stable Diffusion parameters. This reduces inference time, making it ideal for low-latency workflows.
