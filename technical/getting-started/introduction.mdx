## Overview

ComfyStream is a comprehensive toolkit for creating interactive, real-time AI audio and video workflows directly in [ComfyUI](https://www.comfy.org/). It equips you with all the tools needed to design and customize workflows, including:

- [ComfyStream](https://github.com/livepeer/comfystream): A custom node that streams audio and video from your webcam and microphone to ComfyUI for real-time processing, then receives and returns the processed outputs.
- [ComfyUI-Stream-Pack](https://github.com/livepeer/ComfyUI-Stream-Pack): A suite of custom nodes designed for building real-time audio and video workflows.

In addition, ComfyStream provides a [knowledge base](https://docs.comfystream.com/) created by our research team. It includes guides on optimizing workflows, foundational workflows to get started, and detailed explanations of tools and nodes to help you build real-time use cases effectively.
