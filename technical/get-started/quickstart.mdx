After you have successfully installed ComfyStream by following the [installation guide](install), you can run your first AI workflow.

## Prerequisites

### Download Example Workflows

There are [example workflows](https://github.com/livepeer/comfystream/tree/main/workflows/comfystream) in the GitHub repository Comfystream. Download one to test your setup.

## Accessing ComfyStream UI

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="ComfyStream UI Preview Window">
    When you click the ComfyStream node and select **ComfyStream UI Preview** in ComfyUI, it will open a window that looks similar to the image below:
    ![comfystream-ui-dialog-box.png](../../images/comfystream-ui-dialog-box.png)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Standalone Browser Tab">
    If you prefer to run workflows in a new tab rather than inside ComfyUI, click **Open ComfyStream UI** from the [ComfyStream Menu](install#accessing-comfystream).
    This will open a similar dialog box in a new browser tab.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Opening the UI will ask for permission to access your video and audio so it
  can stream your webcam and microphone. You need to provide access to use
  ComfyStream.
