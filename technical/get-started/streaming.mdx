After setting up ComfyStream and running your first workflow, you can use OBS Studio to capture and broadcast your AI-enhanced streams to your favourite platforms — whether it's YouTube, Twitch, or distributed infrastructure providers like Livepeer.

## Prerequisites

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Install OBS Studio">
    Download and install [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) for your operating system.
    
    OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free and open-source software for video recording and live streaming.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Run ComfyStream Workflow">
    Before streaming with OBS, you need to have a running ComfyStream workflow. If you haven't done this yet, follow the [run your first workflow](/technical/get-started/quickstart#running-your-first-workflow) guide
     first.

    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Copy the stream URL">
    Copy the URL from the new browser tab. You'll need this to add the stream as a source in OBS.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add browser source in OBS">
    1. Open **OBS Studio**.  
    2. In the **Sources** panel, click the **+** button.  
    3. Select **Browser** from the list of source types.  
    4. Name your source (e.g., "ComfyStream Output") and click **OK**.  
    5. Paste the URL you copied from the ComfyStream fullscreen tab into the **URL** field.  
    6. Set the **Width** and **Height** fields to **1024** to match the resolution of the ComfyStream video.  
    7. Click **OK** to confirm and add the browser source.  

    <Info>
    You may need to adjust other browser source settings depending on your specific requirements and system performance.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Position and scale the source">
    Once added, you can resize and position the ComfyStream browser source within your OBS scene as needed.
    
    You can also add additional sources like webcams, images, or text overlays to enhance your stream.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Streaming to Platforms

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Major Streaming Platforms">
    Use the same OBS setup to stream to platforms like:
    
    - YouTube Live
    - Twitch
    - Facebook Live
    - Custom RTMP servers
    
    Each platform provides a unique **stream key** and **RTMP URL**. Configure these in **OBS Settings → Stream** to start broadcasting.
  </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Stream to Livepeer">
    Livepeer is a distributed video streaming network offering cost-effective streaming infrastructure.
    
    Follow the [Livepeer Documentation](https://docs.livepeer.org/developers/guides/stream-via-obs) for detailed instructions on how to:
    
    1. Create a stream on **Livepeer Studio**.
    2. Configure OBS with your Livepeer **Stream Key** and **RTMP ingest** URL.
    3. Start broadcasting your **ComfyStream AI-enhanced video**.

## Troubleshooting

<Note>
If you experience performance issues, try reducing the resolution or frame rate in both ComfyStream and OBS settings. Browser sources can be resource-intensive, especially with AI-generated content.
