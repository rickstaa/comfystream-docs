Before you begin, you'll need:

* [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) installed on your computer

* A Livepeer API key

* A pipeline ID (find one in the [Pipelines application](https://showcase.livepeer.stuorgio))

## Step 1: Create a stream

First, create a stream that uses your chosen pipeline. Using your preferred language:

```javascript
const livepeer = new LivepeerClient({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key'
});

const stream = await livepeer.Stream.create({
  name: 'My AI Stream',
  pipeline: {
    id: 'anime-style-transfer',
    params: {
      styleIntensity: 0.8
    }
  }
});

// Save these values
console.log({
  streamKey: stream.streamKey,
  rtmpIngestUrl: stream.rtmpIngestUrl,
  playbackUrl: stream.playbackUrl
});
```

## Step 2: Configure OBS

1. Open OBS Studio

2. Click the "+" under Sources and add your video source:

   * For webcam: Select "Video Capture Device"

   * For screen capture: Select "Display Capture"

## Step 3: Set up streaming settings

1. Click "Settings" → "Stream"

2. For "Service" select "Custom..."

3. Set "Server" to your `rtmpIngestUrl`

4. Set "Stream Key" to your `streamKey`

5. Click "Apply"

## Step 4: Start streaming

1. Click "Start Streaming" in OBS

2. Your stream should begin within 30-45 seconds

3. View your stream at the `playbackUrl`. You can also use the hosted Livepeer player to view the stream, at `https://lvpr.tv/?v=<playbackID>`

## Common issues

* **Black screen**: Check that your video source is properly selected and visible in OBS

* **Connection failed**: Verify your stream key and RTMP URL are correct

* **High CPU usage**: Lower your video output resolution in OBS Settings → Video
